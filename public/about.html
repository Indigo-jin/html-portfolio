<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm Aadya. <br>
  A designer based in Mumbai, majoring in Strategic Design and Management. </p>

<p>
  I'm interested in making stuff that leaves an impact - be it through web design, 3D or any other media. <br>
  I spend my free time listening to podcasts, playing video games or finding hidden gems like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=heavenly+delusion">Heavenly Delusion.</a>
</p>

<p>
  I want to spend my time working with people who have a vision to help humanity. <br> 
  Projects that help connect people, make their life easier or are in line with what humanity innately is. <br>
  If this resonates with you, let's connect :]
