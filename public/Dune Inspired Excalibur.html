<h3>I'll be honest</h3>
<p>I followed a tutorial for this. I had just gotten started with 3D and this was about 1 week in. <br>
  But it taught me a lot of cool things, from texturing to modelling, lighting, volumetric fog and compositing. <br>
  There's a lot that went into this and I'm really happy with how it turned out!
